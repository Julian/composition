Hi mature software developer!

You have decided inheritance isn't your cup of tea?

Well have we got the thing for you!

This module does one thing:

.. code-block:: python

    import composition

    class Superclass(object):
        pass

    class ThisWillGoBoom(Superclass):
        pass


Enjoy. This is mature software, put it in production, and let it drive your
car.

Installation
------------

    $ pip install composition

of course. Python 3.6+ only though, sorry kids.


Wait Wat?
